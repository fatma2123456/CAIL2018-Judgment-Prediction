## 🔍 Approaches to Legal Judgment Prediction

<img src="https://github.com/fatma2123456/CAIL2018-Judgment-Prediction/blob/main/images%20for%20CAIL2018-Judgment/image%20(3).png" alt="Dataset Characteristics Image" style="width:100%; max-width:600px; display:block; margin: 20px auto;">

### Approach 1: Deep Learning Text Classification Models
- **Description:** AI directly predicts judgment outcomes from case facts. It’s like giving the model a case and asking for its verdict.
- **Limitations:** While effective, these models don’t explain *why* they made a particular judgment, leaving us with just the final answer.

### Approach 2: Chain-of-Thought Prompting
- **Description:** A game-changer. This method breaks down predictions into logical steps, helping AI reason through the case in a more human-like way.
- **Output:** Transparent judgments where every prediction is backed by a well-reasoned chain of thought.

### Approach 3: Legal Syllogism Prompting
- **Description:** A powerful structured reasoning method that uses a deductive approach to predict outcomes:
    1. **Law:** Identifying relevant legal rules.
    2. **Fact:** Applying the facts of the case.
    3. **Judgment:** Reaching a conclusion based on the above reasoning.
- **Output:** This method goes beyond simply predicting — it makes the reasoning process transparent and understandable.

## 🚀 SEMDR Model for Legal Judgment Prediction

### 🌍 Overview:
The **Semantic-Aware Dual Encoder Model (SEMDR)** goes beyond surface-level predictions by addressing subtle differences between crimes, handling rare cases, and improving the semantic representation of key facts.

### 🔄 Workflow:
1. **Clue Extraction:**
   - Key facts like motivation, actions, and harm are extracted from case descriptions.
   - Utilizes **BERT** for sentence representation learning to understand legal language deeply.

2. **Reasoning Graph Construction:**
   - A graph-based approach links case facts to predicted judgments, looking at both direct and indirect relationships.
   
3. **Multi-Task Learning:**
   - Simultaneously predicts law articles, charges, and prison terms — all at once, creating a holistic judgment prediction model.

### 🧳 Example Workflow:
- **Input Case Description:** "Tom stole a necklace using a razor blade, injuring the victim."
- **Clue Extraction:** Theft motivation, razor blade use, injury.
- **Output Predictions:** Robbery charge, 60 months imprisonment, Law Article 263.

---

## 🏆 Results

### 🎯 Performance:
- **SEMDR** outperforms **BERT** with an **87.60%** accuracy for robbery predictions compared to just **30.12%** with BERT. That’s an impressive leap forward!
- **Attention Weights:** SEMDR’s attention mechanism focuses on key legal terms like "rob" and "cash," improving its ability to distinguish between similar charges and make accurate predictions.
